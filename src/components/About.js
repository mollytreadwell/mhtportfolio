        <p className="about">
            My name is Molly Treadwell, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. In March 2023, I completed the MIT xPro Full Stack Web Development course, which has equipped me with the latest skills and techniques in web development.
            <br/>
            MIT xPRO revolves around the MERN stack, that is MongoDB, Express, Reactjs and Nodejs. The majority of my applications have been created with React frameworks, including Create-React-App and Nextjs. I particularly enjoyed expanding on my Nextjs projects due to their excellent routing and easy deployment service through Vercel. 
            <br/>
            In addition to MERN, I have aquired a great amount of hands on experience utlizing tools like Docker containers, Amazon Web Services and Git. 
            <br/><br/>

            I hold a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies from Prescott College. Sustainability and ecologic responsibility are personal and professional values of mine which I believe will carry significant weight as we as a global community continue to transition into digitally present, consciousness participants. I recieved a minor in Human Health and Development which has benefitted my ability to care and prioritize physical and mental longevity.
            <br/><br/>

            Currently, I am an independent Landscape and Interior Designer. This industry has significantly shaped my skills in creative problem-solving and project management. These strengths have translated well into other professional sectors, such as my participation in UI/UX design for Boston-based startups.
            <br/>
             Prior to my current professional ties, I served as a consultant for ACRT Inc, a contracting service for Eversource Energy, where I provided the public and local municipalities with technical insight into how particular vegetation management projects would impact the electric grid and how their participation
             would aid in the larger efforts. The majority of my outreach utilized excellent GIS programs, primarily those built by Esri.
             <br/><br/>

            I reside in the Greater Boston Area and enjoy spending my free time outdoors. I am an avid trail runner, hiker, and kayaker, and I love exploring new trails and waterways in the White Mountain and Adirondack regions. I also enjoy traveling, and I find it fascinating to learn about different cultures and their unique perspectives.
            <br/><br/>
            Overall, I am a dedicated and passionate about web design and generating functional, accessible content, and am committed to making a positive impact through my work and personal pursuits.
